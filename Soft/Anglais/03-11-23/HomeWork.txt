Exercice 3:


	1) Name the two countries leading the development of computer piloted car technology.

		The two countries leading the development of computer-piloted car technology are the 
		United States (with companies like Tesla and Waymo) and China (with companies like Baidu).

	2) This article uses the expression “buy the narrative.” What do you think this expression
		means and explain why the author uses it? Use your own words. 
		
		The expression "buy the narrative" means to accept or believe a particular story or viewpoint. 
		In this context, the author is suggesting that people should not unquestionably accept the idea 
		that developing self-driving cars should be treated as a race. The author uses this expression to 
		convey the idea that it's important to critically examine and not blindly accept the prevailing viewpoint 
		on this matter.	

	3) Give two reasons to justify why self-driving car technology is described as a “race.” (2
	points)

		a) Companies want to be perceived as leaders in the field to gain support from employees, 
			investors, regulators, and the public.
		b) The idea of a race can be used to push for faster rule-making and regulations, 
			potentially exposing people to unnecessary risks.

	4) What does Cade Metz suggest as an alternative? (1 point)

		Cade Metz suggests an alternative approach: Instead of trying to win at making driverless cars 
		widespread, there could be a race to steer this technology in the public interest.

	5) What problem is “crowded out” because of focusing on driverless cars? (1 point)

		Focusing on driverless cars may "crowd out" alternative ideas for improving transportation. 
		This means that the intense focus on self-driving cars can divert attention and resources away 
		from other potential solutions to transportation problems.


Exercice 4:
	
	The question of whether the public should be informed when automated vehicles are on the roads is a complex issue. 
	While transparency and safety are essential, it is crucial to recognize that not all potentially risky drivers
	or conditions are subject to public disclosure. This essay will argue that singling out automated vehicles for
	public awareness may not be justified when other dangerous driving behaviors and conditions go unnoticed
	by the public and authorities.

	If we advocate for public awareness of automated vehicles, we must also consider other potential risks on the
	road. People who are intoxicated or under the influence of substances that impair their driving abilities pose
	a significant danger to themselves and others on the road. Yet, their presence is not publicly disclosed,
	and we rely on law enforcement to address these issues. Similarly, individuals with poor eyesight who do
	not wear glasses or contact lenses can pose a safety risk, yet their condition is not made public.
	Therefore, singling out automated vehicles for disclosure creates an inconsistency in road safety measures.

	Mandating public disclosure of automated vehicles may lead to discriminatory treatment.
	The public may develop unwarranted fear or hostility towards these vehicles, assuming they are inherently
	unsafe. This bias can hinder the progress of self-driving technology, causing unwarranted obstacles for
	companies seeking to improve transportation safety.

	Public awareness of automated vehicles' presence may also raise concerns about privacy.
	Just as we do not disclose the identity of drivers who are drunk or have poor eyesight,
	revealing the presence of self-driving cars may infringe on individuals' privacy rights.
	As technology advances, vehicles may carry sensitive information and passengers who value
	their privacy. Requiring the public disclosure of these vehicles may deter individuals from
	using them, limiting the adoption of safer transportation alternatives.

	The rush to publicly disclose automated vehicles may hinder technological progress.
	As highlighted in the article "How Self-Driving Cars Got Stuck in the Slow Lane,"
	the development of self-driving technology is complex and evolving.
	Pushing for immediate disclosure may discourage companies from fine-tuning
	their systems and addressing the challenges related to edge cases, which could delay
	the widespread adoption of safer self-driving technology.

	While safety and transparency are essential, it is crucial to adopt a balanced approach.
	Mandating public awareness of automated vehicles while overlooking other potential risks
	on the road is inconsistent and may lead to discriminatory treatment. It may also raise
	privacy concerns and hinder technological progress. As we consider transparency in road safety,
	we should do so in a manner that addresses all potential risks equally, ensuring a fair and balanced
	approach to transportation safety.
